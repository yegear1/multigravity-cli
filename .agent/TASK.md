## Active Task

### 📌 Task [05.6]: None (Queue Empty — Awaiting Next Task)

- **Description:** All queued tasks (`[05.2]`–`[05.5]`) have been executed, verified, and committed across parallel waves (`W1`/`W2`).
- **Systems Involved:** N/A
- **Action Type:**
  - [ ] Read-only / Documentation
  - [ ] Source code changes
- **Status:** READY FOR PLANNING
  *(Workflow: `READY FOR PLANNING` → `PLANNING` on presenting plan → approval → `RUNNING`)*

## Backlog (Upcoming, in priority order)

> Tag pre-approved tasks having strictly disjoint file scopes with `[APPROVED]` `[PARALLEL: W1]` and `Paths: ...` for concurrent `task-queue` execution.

- [ ] *(Queue empty — awaiting next planning session)*

---

## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

- [ ] **[99.1]** Prepare Release (Git Tag) and Sanitize Context — Human permission required

---

## Future Backlog / Ideas (Unprioritized)

- [ ] *(Queue empty — awaiting next ideation)*

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Detailed design specifications live in `docs/adr/decisions.md`. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task).
