## Active Task

### 📌 Task [00.5]: Align repository governance with brownfield template knowledge base schema and documentation standards

- **Description:** Synchronize repository governance with latest upstream brownfield template: install `.agent/knowledge/` schema and card template, declare knowledge base context trigger and DoD item in `AGENTS.md`, align `ARCHIVE.md` header to canonical Technical English, and add `.agent/.cache/` and `.agent/scratch/` to `.gitignore`.
- **Systems Involved:** `governance`, `documentation`
- **Action Type:**
  - [x] Read-only / Documentation
  - [ ] Source code changes
- **Status:** COMPLETED
  *(Workflow: `READY FOR PLANNING` → `PLANNING` on presenting plan → approval → `RUNNING`)*

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `.agent/knowledge/000-schema.md` and `.agent/knowledge/k-000-template.md` conforming to template standards.
- [x] Update `AGENTS.md` to include Knowledge Base in Modular Context Triggers and Definition of Done.
- [x] Align `.agent/ARCHIVE.md` header to Technical English (`# ARCHIVE.md — Historical Log of Completed Tasks`).
- [x] Ensure `.gitignore` covers `.agent/scratch/` and `.agent/.cache/`.
- [x] All tests pass (`go test ./...`) and `git diff --check` exits with code 0.

## Backlog (Upcoming, in priority order)

- [ ] *(Queue empty — awaiting next prioritization)*

## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

- [ ] **[99.1]** Prepare Release (Git Tag) and Sanitize Context — Human permission required

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Detailed design specifications live in `docs/adr/decisions.md`. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task).
